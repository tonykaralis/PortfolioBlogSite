                <p class="lead">Memory Management in C++ is not the monster you think it is!</p>

                <p>
                  The buzz words I keep hearing these days are mainly Java, C# and Objective-C. It seems that everyone’s focus is set on the above
                   mentioned and we seem to be forgetting about our good old C++. There are a large number of developers and programmers who will
                   fight for hours arguing about which language is better, more popular or the latest comment I’ve been reading “All application
                   development is in ‘my’ language”. This really cracks me up and reading those discussions can make one laugh for hours. There is no ‘one
                   size fits all’ language in my opinion.
                </p>

                <p>Now just to clear things up, I’m not here to promote any language over another and the answer to your question is yes I do love C++. However,
                  this article is here to inform any undergrads or new coders to be, who are looking for some guidance while starting out their C++ journey.
                </p>

                <p>The C++ learning curve can be steep but in my opinion it is well worth it. Those who have worked with the language long enough know the various
                  difficulties of the language and its drawbacks. I will discuss the most common
                  one I hear “memory management is hard”. Now I am going to have to agree with this one, it is hard indeed but only if you are  doing it wrong.</p>

                <p> Firstly, I need to explain the stack and the heap for those who have not heard of them before. Think of the stack as an organized tower of variables,
                  one on top of the other. When a variable goes out of scope it is removed from the stack.
                  The space that variable took up is known as stack memory. All objects created on the stack are going to be destroyed at the end of the local scope.</p>

                <p>Here’s some code to help you understand:</p>
<pre><code>
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
  {
    int  a; //created on the stack
    a = 10;
    if( a < 20 )
    {
      int b;  //created on the stack
      int c;  //created ont the stack

      b = 5;
      c = 6;
      a = b + c;
    } //here b and c go out of scope, they are removed from the stack

    cout << c;  //output c to the screen
    return 0; /application comes to an end and a goes out of scope
  }
</code></pre>



                <p>This piece of code adds variable a to the stack, a is initialized and then
                  depending on a certain condition a new block of code is entered. In this new block of code we see that
                  b and c are then added to the stack. Both variables are initialized and a simple operation is performed(irrelevant to the explanation).
                  Then the program leaves that block of code on line 20, at this point the stack is aware that variable b and c are going out of scope and
                  thus removes them from the stack. A simple output statement follows which will produce an error since c is out of scope and finally our
                  program execution comes to an end and the last variable a is removed from the stack.</p>

                <p>As we can see from the example, the stack is quite handy as the program will handle the removal
                  of all stack variables for you. Always use the stack unless you have an extremely good reason not to.</p>

                <p> Pretty straight forward. Lets move on to the heap now.</p>

                <p>For all coders to be don’t let the word heap frighten you, it is nothing to be afraid of unless you use it incorrectly.
                  Think of the heap as a big bowl of variables where there is no order and organization like that of the stack, it is just one big pile of memory.
                  The plus side is we have loads of it available to us, usually as much as is available on your device. Now this is where things get interesting.
                  Whenever we speak about manual memory management in C++ the heap is what we are talking about.</p>

                  <p>In order to create a variable on the heap and then manually destroy it, one needs to use the “new” and “delete” operators.This part gets a bit tricky
                    to understand if you have not heard of or grasped the concept of pointers. If you need a quick explanation on pointers check out my post <a href="blog-cpppointers">Crash
                    course on C++ pointers.</a></p>

                    <p>Here is an extremely simple example:</p>
  <pre><code>
1      #include iostream
2
3      using namespace std;
4
5      void addFive(int* number)
6      {
7        *number += 5;
8      }
9
10      int main()
11     {
12      int* i = new int();
13
14      *i = 1;
15
16      addFive(i);
17
18      cout << *i;
19
20      delete i;
21
22      return 0;
23      }
  </code></pre>

  <p>Right, lets get started. We can see from line 8 that we are creating a pointer i that actually points to a type int. This is what is a bit tricky to
    understand.
    A pointer is not the same type that it points to. A pointer is merely a location in memory that can be referenced by its address.</p>

  <p> Firstly, I need to explain the stack and the heap for those who have not heard of them before. Think of the stack as an organized tower of variables,
    one on top of the other. When a variable goes out of scope it is removed from the stack.
    The space that variable took up is known as stack memory. All objects created on the stack are going to be destroyed at the end of the local scope.</p>

  <p>Here’s some code to help you understand:</p>
<pre><code>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int  a; //created on the stack
a = 10;
if( a < 20 )
{
int b;  //created on the stack
int c;  //created ont the stack

b = 5;
c = 6;
a = b + c;
} //here b and c go out of scope, they are removed from the stack

cout << c;  //output c to the screen
return 0; /application comes to an end and a goes out of scope
}
</code></pre>

      <p>Here is an extremely simple example:</p>
<pre><code>
1      #include <iostream>
2
3      using namespace std;
4
5      void addFive(int* number)
6      {
7        *number += 5;
8      }
9
10      int main()
11     {
12      int* i = new int();
13
14      *i = 1;
15
16      addFive(i);
17
18      cout << *i;
19
20      delete i;
21
22      return 0;
23      }
</code></pre>

  <ul>
      <li>Line 5-8: we define a simple function that accepts a pointer to a type int and we add 5 to the value the pointer points to.</li>
      <li>Line 12: we declare a pointer to type int on the heap using the “new” operator      </li>
      <li>Line 14: we dereference the pointer and set the value it points to to be 1      </li>
      <li>Line 16: we call the addFive function and pass the pointer as a parameter      </li>
      <li>Line 18: we dereference the pointer for use in outputting the value it points to.      </li>
      <li>Line 20: we use the delete operator to delete the pointer and release the allocated memory on the heap. (This is vital or else we will have a memory leak)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The output of the above will be: 6.</p>

  <p>Now you might think well what was the point of doing all of that? Why not just pass a variable of type int instead of creating pointers etc?</p>

  <p>Well we see the advantages when handling larger data structures and custom types ie an array of 20 MB.</p>

  <p>Firstly, we wouldn’t be able to create an array of that size on the stack, give it a try and note the error message.</p>
  <p>Secondly, when passing a variable by value to another function, we are essentially creating a copy of that variable and using the copy in the function.
    This means our program would have to copy a 20MB array to use it in a function. Using pointers we are not coying the array but rather passing the address
    of that array, and if my memory serves me right the size of a memory address on a 64-bit machine is 8 bytes. Big difference between 8 bytes and 20MB.</p>
  <p>Finally, all objects created on the heap (using “new”)  will not be destroyed unless we manually free the resources they have been allocated. This is
    why we must call “delete” for every time we use “new”. That right there
    is the major pitfall to pointers in C++. It may not seem clear in the above example, but imagine forgetting a single delete in 20000 lines of code.</p>
  <p>Personally i would avoid using the new and delete operators as much as possible. It is dangerous and the fact is there is another solution. In fact there are 2.
    The first solution involves using the QT Framework which I will discuss in another post. The second solution is the use of smart pointers.</p>
    <p>These little guys are a life saver. A smart pointer is essentially a pointer-like class that wraps a raw C++ pointer in order to manage its
      lifetime thus relieving us of the
      duty of calling delete every time.</p>
    <p>Here is a simple example demonstrating the use of the std::unique_ptr.</p>

<pre><code>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
unique_ptr<int> ptr1(new int(10));
cout << *ptr1 << endl;
return 0;
}

</code></pre>
    <p>Don’t forget to include the header memory and tell your compiler to use ISO standard C++11 otherwise you will get a ton of errors.</p>
    <p>Thats all for today. Happy coding.</p>
