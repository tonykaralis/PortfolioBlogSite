                <p class="lead">How does Qt Creator compile your program?</p>
                <p class="lead">If it does it for us, then why do we even need to know how its done?</p>

                <p>
                  You might think these are silly questions but I believe that knowing what is going on under the hood will help you understand in depth
                  what Qt is doing for you, what you need to do and help you troubleshoot various errors that may arise along the way saving you a lot of
                  time in the long run.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For those of you who have worked with CodeBlocks take a moment to reflect on the process to create,
                  compile and build a project using CodeBlocks. For those of you who haven’t ill tell you thats it is as straight forward as it gets.
                </p>

                <p>Now lets begin. Each Qt program needs a makefile.
                  For those of you who don’t know what that is, a makefile is simply a special file that contains different shell commands that tell
                  the system what commands need to be executed. Working with small projects, the makefiles are easy to write. Writing a makefile becomes a
                  mission when moving to larger projects. So Qt has something called “qmake” that generates this file for us.
                  This makefile is used to compile our program. Qt however also uses this makefile to store its meta-object extraction phase.
                  All you need to know about this now is that Qt extends C++ by using meta-objects.
                </p>

                <h3>So here’s what happens when Qt compiles our program:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>A .pro file is generated that describes your project(header files, source files, libraries etc)      </li>
                    <li>qmake generates a makefile</li>
                    <li>the program is then built using make or nmake</li>
                </ul>

                <p> So as we can see Qt is doing quite a bit in the background when we hit the build and run button.
                  If we chose not to use Qt Creator we would then need to use the command line to perform all the above mentioned steps.</p>

                <p>Now as we can see step 1 involves a .pro file. We need to go into more detail as to what actually goes into that file.
                  You can think of that file as the “manager” of your program. Forget to include a simple header path you will have errors.</p>

                <p>Below is the bare minimum that appears in a .pro when creating an empty Qt console application.</p>

 <pre><code>
 QT += core
 QT -= gui
 CONFIG += c++11
 TARGET = Test1
 CONFIG += console
 CONFIG -= app_bundle
 TEMPLATE = app
 SOURCES += main.cpp
 </code></pre>

                <p> All the words on the left are variables. qmake reads this project file and looks for certain variables,
                  the contents of these variables are used to generate the makefile. Let me explain some of the main variables you will most definitely be using.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>QT: This will hold Qt specific configuration options. If we want to create a console application we will add the line 1, for a GUI application
                      we add line 2 from above, to incorporate SQL we should add QT += sql. Check QT docs for more about Qt specific config options</li>
                    <li>TARGET: The name of the target project</li>
                    <li>CONFIG: This is general project configuration options. Beginners don’t need to fiddle with that just yet.</li>
                    <li>TEMPLATE : This is used to define whether we will be creating a library, app or plugin</li>
                    <li>SOURCES: We use this to include our C++ source files</li>
                    <li>HEADERS: These are used to add our C++ header files</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Those are the basics you will need to know about the project file.</p>

                <p>Tip of note: Certain errors may occur mentioning undefined reference to vtable especially when we work with QMetaObject, QMetaProperty
                  as well as the QOBJECT and Q_PROPERTY macros. This may happen due to the moc reading the old C++ source file containing the meta-object information
                  for those classes or it simply has not created one yet. These errors on some occasions can be fixed by simply running qmake again. A good way to do
                  this is to hit build->clean project ‘..’, then hit build->run qmake and then finally build and run your program again. This is not always the case,
                   it is just a tip to hopefully save you debugging for 6 days and then burning your laptop when you give up.</p>

                <p>Now I know you may be asking yourself what is moc?? Very good question. moc stands for meta object compiler. It is the program that handles
                  Qt’s C++ extensions.
                  What the moc does is read a C++ header file and checks to see if it contains the Q_OBJECT macro (this is used for signals & slots and dynamic
                  properties just to name a few) and if so proceeds to generate a C++ source file that contains information about the meta-object code for those classes.
                  This C++ source file must be compiled and linked with the implementation of the class. Your native build system will still be invoked(GNU make,
                  MS nmake etc) which will  then call your native compiler(g++/gcc etc). moc in no way replaces that process but rather adds to it.</p>

                <p>Hopefully this has shed some light on what goes on behind the scenes. You can now see that Qt does operate quite differently
                  from CodeBlocks in several aspects. This should help you get up and running quicker.</p>
